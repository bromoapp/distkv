# Distkv

## Description

I made this simple project, based on [this](https://github.com/mmmries/dkv) repo, that uses [this](https://github.com/lindenbaum/lbm_kv) project to provides distributed key-value in-memory db for elixir project.

Based on [this](https://github.com/mmmries/dkv) project, you are **required to link all nodes** using **sys.config** file before you can get fully distributed mnesia for your distributed app.
